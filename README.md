Sketch Plugins
=============

I'll be publishing my [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) plugins here as I create them.

## Plugins

### Page-to-PNG

Exports an entire page of artboards as a PNG.

* __Page Name Appended to Filename__ - The exported PNG includes the name of the page that has been exported.
* __Background Color__ - You can choose between a light gray or dark gray background.
* __Artboard Titles__ - You have the option to include or hide the artboard titles in the exported PNG.
