Sketch Plugins
=============

I'll be publishing my [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) plugins here as I create them.  Right now I just have one plugin that was made from [Josh Puckett](https://github.com/joshpuckett/SketchPlugins)'s "Save Page to PNG" plugin.

## Plugins

### Page-to-PNG

Adds minor (but important) functionality to [Josh Puckett](https://github.com/joshpuckett/SketchPlugins)'s "Save Page to PNG" plugin.

* __Page Name Appended to Filename__ - The exported PNG includes the name of the page that has been exported.  "SketchProject.png" would now be something like "SketchProject-Page1.png"
* __Background Color__ - The exported PNG no longer has a transparent background which made it hard to distinguish between artboards/objects when sharing over things like CloudApp.
